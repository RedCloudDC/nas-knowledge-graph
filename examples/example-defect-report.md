## Bug Description
Graph rendering fails on Safari 15.0 when loading datasets larger than 500 nodes, causing the browser to freeze and requiring a force refresh.

## Test Information
- **Test Type**: [x] Cross-Browser Test [ ] Unit Test [ ] E2E Test [ ] Performance Test [ ] Manual Test
- **Test Suite**: cross-browser-test.js, large-dataset scenario
- **Browser**: Safari 15.0 on macOS Monterey
- **Device**: MacBook Pro (Desktop)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the application in Safari 15.0
2. Load a dataset with >500 nodes via 'Load Sample Data' → 'Large Dataset'
3. Wait for initial render
4. Browser becomes unresponsive after ~10 seconds
5. Force refresh required to recover

## Expected Behavior
The graph should render smoothly with all nodes visible and interactive, similar to Chrome and Firefox behavior with the same dataset.

## Actual Behavior
- Browser becomes unresponsive during initial rendering
- Console shows memory warnings
- No nodes are visible on screen
- Browser tab shows "Not Responding" status
- Application becomes completely unusable

## Screenshots/Videos

![Unresponsive Browser](screenshots/safari-unresponsive.png)

## Error Messages/Logs
```
[Error] Out of memory (D3GraphRenderer.js:234)
[Warning] Memory pressure detected - consider reducing node count
[Error] WebGL context lost - unable to recover
Console: Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

## Environment
- **OS**: macOS 12.6 Monterey
- **Browser**: Safari 15.0 (17612.1.29.41.4)
- **Version**: Desktop
- **Device**: MacBook Pro 16" 2021 (M1 Pro, 16GB RAM)

## Performance Impact
- [x] Application unusable
- [ ] Major performance impact
- [ ] Minor performance degradation
- [ ] No performance impact

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: [x] Pass [ ] Fail [ ] N/A - DataLoader tests pass
- **E2E Tests**: [ ] Pass [x] Fail [ ] N/A - Timeout on large dataset scenario
- **Performance Tests**: [ ] Pass [x] Fail [ ] N/A - Exceeds memory threshold  
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: [ ] Pass [x] Fail [ ] N/A - Safari-specific failure

## Regression Information
- [x] New issue in this version
- [ ] Existing issue that got worse
- [ ] Previously fixed issue that returned

**Details**: This issue appeared after implementing the new chunked data processing feature. Chrome and Firefox handle the same dataset without issues.

## Priority/Severity
- [x] Critical - Application unusable
- [ ] High - Major functionality broken
- [ ] Medium - Minor functionality issue
- [ ] Low - Cosmetic/minor issue

## Additional Context

### Frequency of occurrence
- 100% reproducible with datasets >500 nodes
- Works fine with <300 nodes
- Inconsistent behavior between 300-500 nodes

### Workarounds
1. Use Chrome or Firefox instead of Safari
2. Limit dataset size to <300 nodes
3. Enable "Develop" menu and increase memory limits (partial fix)

### Related issues
- Similar memory issues reported in D3.js GitHub: issue #12345
- WebGL context loss documented in Safari WebKit bugs: #234567

### Impact on users
- Affects ~15% of users (Safari market share)
- Particularly impacts Mac users who prefer Safari
- Blocks large-scale data analysis workflows
- May affect enterprise adoption

### Browser-specific details
- Safari's JavaScript engine has stricter memory limits
- WebGL context handling differs from Chromium-based browsers
- Garbage collection patterns may contribute to memory pressure

### Performance measurements
- Memory usage peaks at 1.2GB (Safari limit: 1GB)
- Chrome handles same dataset with 800MB peak usage
- Rendering time: Safari 45s+ vs Chrome 3.2s

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Bug is reproduced consistently ✅ (100% repro rate)
- [ ] Root cause is identified 🔍 (Investigation in progress)
- [ ] Fix is implemented ⚠️ (Pending root cause analysis)
- [ ] Fix is tested and verified ⏳ (Waiting for implementation)
- [ ] Regression tests are updated ⏳ (Will add Safari-specific memory tests)
- [ ] Documentation is updated ⏳ (Will update browser compatibility docs)

## Technical Analysis

### Memory Profile
```
Initial load: 200MB
After data load: 800MB  
During rendering: 1.2GB+ (exceeds Safari limit)
```

### Potential Root Causes
1. **Memory Leak in D3 Selection**: Large DOM manipulations may not be properly garbage collected
2. **WebGL Buffer Overflow**: Too many vertices being allocated at once
3. **Safari-specific GC Issues**: Different garbage collection timing vs other browsers
4. **Inefficient Data Structures**: Array/object creation patterns may be Safari-hostile

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Chunked Rendering**: Process nodes in smaller batches
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Add Safari-specific memory checks
3. **WebGL Optimization**: Use instanced rendering for large datasets
4. **Lazy Loading**: Only render visible nodes initially

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Add Safari-specific performance tests
- [ ] Implement memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Create automated large dataset tests
- [ ] Add WebGL context loss recovery
